# AIN-311_Project: Predicting CO2 Emissions of Passenger Cars

As the climate change becoming a global problem over the years, reducing co2 emission became a primal goal. Passenger cars are a significant contributor to co2 emissions, making it essential to understand and predict real-world emissions accurately. This project aims to predict real-life co2 emissions of passenger cars using given laboratory test information and real-world user-submitted or automatically recorded data.
